Apple describe iOS as having an "Elegant and intuitive interface" that "You know how to use...from the first time you pick it up."

It's intuitive because it's obvious. Tap/pinch to zoom, rotate gesture, drag to scroll: all obvious gestures. Non-obvious gestures (place phone on the ground and do a handstand to zoom) didn't make the cut.

Now answer this: if the gestures are successful because they are obvious to a lay user from the first time he picks it up, how can they be patented if the main criteria for these patents is that they are non-obvious to a professional user interface designer?
